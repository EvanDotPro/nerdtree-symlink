This is a plugin for NERDTree to allow for creating symlinks from within Vim.

To use, place the cursor on the file/directory you wish to create a symlink to.
Open the file menu in NERDTree using <m>, then hit <s>. You will get an input
field with the current path populated. Change this path to represent where you'd
like the symlink to be created and hit enter.
